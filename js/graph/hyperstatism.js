/*
Those functions are used to compute hyperstaticity in a graph from the cycles and graph
We used a french mathematical tool named kinetic torsor (torseur cin√©matique) define as 2 sets of 3 mobilities. The first set is the 3 rotations, that does not depends on the point of application. We call it resultante
The seconde set is the moment, and is compose of the 3 translations in space. It does depends on the point of application and should be displaced. All calculations for the moment should be done at the same point. We choose the point of the first link
The torsor is defined as
{
    wx, wy, wz
    Vx, Vy, Vy
}
w corresponds to rotations (speeds, because it's a kinetic torsor)
V are translation speeds and depends of the position of the point

Then we compute the hyperstaticity with those torsor and the kinematic method. This method differs when we study a group of two nodes (local hyperstaticity) and a cycle (global hyperstaticity)
Then, we add all hyperstaticity to find the total
